		We don't sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don't share information that directly
		identifies you (such as your name, email address, or other contact information) with advertisers
		unless you give us specific permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things such as the kind
		of audience that they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may be
		interested. We provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads that help
		them understand how people are interacting with their content.

		of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off
